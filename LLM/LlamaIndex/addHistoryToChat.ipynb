Elevating your feet or the head side of your bed slightly can improve sleep quality, but be cautious if you have acid reflux. For those with sleep apnea, consider training yourself to be a nose breather during sleep. Avoid consuming a lot of fluids right before bed to prevent disruptions due to needing to urinate. Be cautious with serotonin supplements as they may affect the timing of REM sleep and slow wave sleep.\n"

It's important to be cautious of using earplugs if they cause discomfort or disrupt your sleep, and to be mindful of not elevating your ankles too high if you suffer from acid reflux. Additionally, being aware of caffeine intake and its timing, as well as considering the use of supplements like magnesium threonate, apigenin, theanine, glycine, GABA, and inositol can also help optimize sleep quality.\n"
