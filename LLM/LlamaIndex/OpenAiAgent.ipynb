Those kids would love to be off \\nthe ketogenic diet. Their parents would love to have them off the ketogenic diet. \\nANDREW HUBERMAN: They had no birthday cake, no ice cream. CHRIS PALMER: \\nThere is not one case report of a ny child controlling his or her seizures using exogenous \\nketones without also doing the ketogenic diet. I just find it hard to believe that at least \\nsome of those people haven't tried it out to see. I do know some patients with bipolar \\ndisorder and even sc hizophrenia who are doing extraordinarily well on a ketogenic diet. \\nThey have tried to switch off the ketogenic diet using exogenous ketones. Their \\nsymptoms came back. And so they found that it just wasn't effective. Now, again, those \\nare anecdotes. My sci entific speculation about why is because the ketogenic diet is \\nactually not necessarily about ketones themselves. Ketones are one of a multifaceted \\nstory there. And so when people do a ketogenic diet, they're also improving -- they're \\nlowering glucose level s. They're improving insulin signaling. They're ramping up \\nmitochondrial biogenesis, in particular, in the liver because mitochondria actually make \\nketones. That's where they're made. And they're primarily made in the liver \\nmitochondria. So when somebody i s on in a fasting state or on a ketogenic diet, their \\nliver mitochondria go through the roof because they're being called to action. It's like, \\nhey, body's in starvation mode. Get to work. And so the mitochondria -- the cell senses \\nwe need more mitochondria  to process fat to turn it into ketones so that those ketones \\ncan get up to the brain and keep the brain fueled, because fatty acids can't fuel the \\nbrain. Only ketones can. Now, so my sense is that -- and the gut microbiome changes \\nand everything, the chang es in hormones -- so if you're eating a lot of donuts and \\ndrinking a bottle of ketones, the donuts are going to prevent your body from lowering \\nglucose levels. You're still going to have the high glucose levels from the donuts. You're \\nstill going to probabl y have the impaired insulin signaling. You're probably still going to \\npossibly have some inflammation from the inflammatory effects of that food. And so just \\ndrinking ketones alone won't be enough. I think for people who are metabolically healthy, \\nI'll inc lude you in that, I think ketones can play a really beneficial role, no doubt. I think \\nexogenous ketones may, in fact, proven valuable in clinical use for patients who maybe \\ncan't follow a super strict ketogenic diet but maybe could do a low carb diet. And  then \\ngiven the research that's happening with alcohol use disorder, I could imagine a \\nsituation -- here's the million dollar tip to whoever wants to go out and get this, if it \\nactually turns out to be true.

How do you deal with those adjustments? And I \\nguess we could expand this conversation and say, wha t about male fertility also? \\nBecause some caloric diets seem to -- my understanding is that submaintenance caloric \\ndiets, so weight loss diets, will improve testosterone -estrogen ratios in males that are \\nobese. But for someone that\\'s not obese, to go on a s ub-caloric diet, that it can start to \\nimpair testosterone levels and -- probably not render them infertile but certainly adjust \\nthat whole axis. So what about interactions between ketosis, diets, et cetera, and the \\nendocrine system? CHRIS PALMER: The real a nswer is, I don\\'t think anybody knows. \\nAnd there\\'s not a one -size-fits-all answer because I\\'ve seen examples. And I\\'m aware of \\nscience to back up polar opposite conclusions. So the first general observation that I\\'ll \\nmake -- I know so many couples, husbands  and wives, boyfriends and girlfriends, \\nheterosexual couples, who have tried the ketogenic diet to lose weight together -- \\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And end up with a baby? No, I\\'m just kidding. [LAUGHS] \\nCHRIS PALMER: No. Almost universally, the men have a much easi er time with it than \\nthe women. It\\'s not across the board. But I know so many examples where the women \\nsay I couldn\\'t tolerate that diet. It did not make me feel better. It actually made me feel \\nworse. And I think in those cases, it probably does relate to  hormones. I\\'m aware of \\nanimal models, of mice -- in particular, ketogenic diet in mouse models. One researcher \\nshared with me, the thing that was striking is that the female mice never got pregnant on \\nthe ketogenic diet. Whereas, the mice on the standard d iet were just having babies right \\nand left. And it was just shocking, the difference. On the surface, it makes sense. The \\nketogenic diet is mimicking the fasting state. Women who are trying to reproduce should \\nnot be fasting. If your body is in a fasting s tate, it probably does not want to expend \\nresources, metabolic resources, calories, nutrients, and other things, to creating a baby \\nbecause your very life is being threatened by, quote unquote, \"fasting\" or starvation. \\nThat even though the ketogenic diet i s a sustainable, nonstarvation diet, we\\'re really \\nusing that diet to trick the body into thinking that it is in a fasting or starvation state. And \\nso just from a kind of evolutionary stance, it makes sense that women\\'s bodies may \\nactually have significant changes in hormonal status to prevent pregnancy because a \\nwoman should not be having a baby when she\\'s starving to death. I know of examples of \\nwomen who are the opposite, though, who have benefited dramatically and \\ntremendously from the ketogenic diet, ha ve put schizophrenia, bipolar disorder into full \\nremission.
